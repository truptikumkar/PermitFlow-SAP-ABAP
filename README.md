# PermitFlow-SAP-ABAP

A custom SAP ABAP Module Pool application designed to streamline role-based request management in a real-time enterprise scenario. It enables seamless communication between three distinct user roles: **Requester (A)**, **Approver (B)**, and **Issuer (C)**. The system handles request creation, approval, and issuance with robust validations, status tracking, number range-based request ID generation, and ALV-based reporting.
